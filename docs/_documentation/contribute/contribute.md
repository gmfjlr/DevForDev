* **new code** - including pull requests via GitHub - or you can fork the project and build your own extensions
* **new plugins** - can be hosted in your own repositories
* please do blog about your adventures with DevForDev!
* please suggest editions for the documentation files - we're currently light on documentation!
* if you use the framework, then please let us know - we love to see what people are doing with it
