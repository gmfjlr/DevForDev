## Naming Conventions

Consistency is the key to maintainable code.

This statement is most true for naming your projects, source files, and identifiers including Variables, Properties, Methods, parameters, Classes, Interfaces, and Namespaces

Indentifier Type | Rules for Naming | Example
-----------------|------------------|--------
Namespaces | Pascal Case – Should start with company namespace, followed by application “layers” as applicable | Con.DataServices.Contacts

### Case Sensitivity

To avoid confusion, follow these rules regarding the use of case sensitivity:
  - DO NOT create two namespaces with names that differ only by case.  
  - DO NOT create a method with parameter names that differ only by case.  
  - DO NOT create methods with names that only differ by single leter or number.  
  - DO NOT create a type with property names that differ only by case  
  - DO NOT create a type with method names that differs only by case.  
  - DO NOT create variables with type that differs only by case.  
  - DO NOT create variables matching data type using a different casing.
