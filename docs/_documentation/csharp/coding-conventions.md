Please visit [C# Coding Conventions (C# Programming Guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions/)

### Coding conventions serve the following purposes:

  - They create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout.
  - They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.
  - They facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.
  - They demonstrate C# best practices.

The guidelines in this topic are used by Microsoft to develop samples and documentation.
